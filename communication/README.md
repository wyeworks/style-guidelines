# Communication Guide

## General tips
- Focus on the content of the message. Avoid getting carried away by emotions or feelings, and judge only the content.
- Don't assume. Not everybody has the same context or know what to
  expect from the rest. Make conscious effort to have everyone on the
  same page.
- Always Listen First. Seek first to understand then to be understood.
- Be context aware. Context is implicit in any communication. Culture,
  language, feelings, past experiences, all that affect the way we communicate.
- Make sure you're understood. Talk slow and clear. Be confident in what
  you're saying, prepare the message first. Double check everyone got
  the correct message.
- Leave your ego at the door. Accept that everyone makes mistakes, including
  yourself. Be open to feedback.
- Have empathy. Consider how others will receive your message, and
  communicate in a way you would like to be talked to. Don't judge,
  show respect and appreciation.
- Use visual aids. Some people prefer visual content. Use it to help
  transmit your ideas.
- Be aware of body language. Smile, look to the eyes, have a body
  posture that welcomes communication. Your attitude says more than your
  words.

## Daily meeting
- Prepare them with anticipation. Don't improvise.
- Give as much context as possible.
- Use the best setup possible to reduce impact of remotism.

## Retrospective
- Assume good intentions and best effort.
- Focus on how to solve the problem, not finding who's guilty.

## Code Reviews
- Review the code the way you'd like your code to be reviewed.
- Ask or suggest instead of demanding.
- Use examples to help make your point.
- Judge the code, not the people.
